name: skill-installer
description: "Install, download, or add new skills and plugins into the router-based skill organization. Use when the user asks to download a skill, install a plugin, add a new skill to the system, integrate a .skill file, register a new capability, or onboard a skill/plugin into the existing router hierarchy."

# Skill Installer

Install new skills/plugins into the two-tier skill organization system.

## Architecture

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── <direct-skill>/SKILL.md        ← Invoked directly from command line (/qa, /ship, etc.)
├── <router>/SKILL.md              ← Routes to GUIDE.md files based on context
│   └── <skill-name>/GUIDE.md      ← Hidden from picker, loaded by router
├── (workflow) phase-*/SKILL.md    ← Workflow phases (also reference GUIDE.md files)
└── archive/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md  ← Shared skills referenced by multiple routers/workflows
```

### Key rules
- **SKILL.md** = visible in the Claude skill picker, invokable from command line
- **GUIDE.md** = hidden from picker, only loaded when another skill reads it
- **Routers** = SKILL.md files that contain routing tables pointing to GUIDE.md files
- **Archive** = flat directory of GUIDE.md skills shared across multiple routers/workflows
- A skill goes in **archive/** when it's referenced by 2+ routers/workflows OR doesn't belong to a single router
- A skill goes **under a router** when it belongs to exactly one domain

## Router Registry

## Installation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the skill

Read the new skill's SKILL.md, README, or description. Determine:
- What does it do?
- Should the user be able to invoke it as a `/command`?
- Which router(s) should reference it?

### Step 2: Place the skill file

Two questions, in order:

**Q1: Should this be a `/command`?**

```
YES → Place as SKILL.md at top level:
      ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
      (Visible in picker, user invokes /skill-name)

NO  → Place as GUIDE.md in archive:
      ~/.claude/skills/archive/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md
      (Hidden from picker, only loaded by routers)
```

**Q2: Which router(s) should reference it?**

Every skill — whether command or archive — must be routed. Determine which routers
should surface this skill based on context, then add a path entry to each router.

### Step 3: Add router entries

For each router that should reference the skill, add a row to its routing table
pointing to the skill's actual file path:

**If the skill is a direct command** (SKILL.md at top level):
```markdown
| <trigger context> | Read `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` |
```

**If the skill is in archive** (GUIDE.md):
```markdown
| <trigger context> | Read `~/.claude/skills/archive/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md` |
```

**If the skill is under a single router** (GUIDE.md nested under router):
```markdown
| <trigger context> | Read `~/.claude/skills/<router>/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md` |
```

Match the router's existing table format:
- Routers with `| Context | Action |` tables → add with explicit path
- Routers with `| Sub-skill | Triggers |` tables (implicit path from router name) →
  add a separate "Cross-referenced skills" section with `| Context | Action |` format
  for skills that live outside the router directory

### Step 4: Handle special cases

**Skill belongs to exactly one router and is NOT a command:**
Place under that router instead of archive:
```
~/.claude/skills/<router>/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md
```

**Skill needs a new router (no existing router fits):**
1. Create `~/.claude/skills/<new-router>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter + routing table
2. Place the skill as GUIDE.md (under the router or in archive)
3. Update the Router Registry table in THIS skill (skill-installer)

**Option C — Archive (shared/cross-cutting):**
```
~/.claude/skills/archive/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md
```
1. Move/copy the skill folder into archive/
2. Rename `SKILL.md` → `GUIDE.md`
3. Keep all internal files

### Step 4: Register in routing tables

For **Option B** (router skill):
1. Read `~/.claude/skills/<router>/SKILL.md`
2. Add a row to the routing table:
   ```markdown
   | <context description> | Read `~/.claude/skills/<router>/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md` |
   ```
3. Update the router's YAML `description` if new trigger keywords are needed

For **Option C** (archive skill):
1. Add a row to EVERY router that should reference it:
   ```markdown
   | <context description> | Read `~/.claude/skills/archive/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md` |
   ```
2. Update the Archive Contents table in THIS skill (skill-installer)

For **plugin skills**, use this format instead:
```markdown
| <context description> | Invoke plugin `<plugin-name>:<skill-name>` via Skill tool |
```

### Step 5: New router (only if no existing router fits)

If the skill needs a router that doesn't exist:

1. Create `~/.claude/skills/<new-router>/SKILL.md` with:
   - YAML frontmatter: `name` + broad `description` covering the category
   - Routing table pointing to the new skill's GUIDE.md
2. Place the skill inside: `~/.claude/skills/<new-router>/<skill-name>/GUIDE.md`
3. **Update this skill**: Add the new router to the Router Registry table above

### Step 6: Verify

1. Confirm the GUIDE.md is readable at its new path
2. Confirm every router that references it has the correct table entry
3. If a new router was created, confirm it appears in the skill picker
4. If archived, confirm the Archive Contents table in this skill is updated
