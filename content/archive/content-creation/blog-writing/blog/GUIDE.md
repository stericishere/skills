# Blog -- Content Engine for Rankings & AI Citations

Full-lifecycle blog management: strategy, briefs, outlines, writing, analysis,
optimization, schema generation, repurposing, and editorial planning. Dual-optimized
for Google's December 2025 Core Update and AI citation platforms (ChatGPT,
Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini).

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/blog write <topic>` | Write a new blog post from scratch |
| `/blog rewrite <file>` | Rewrite/optimize an existing blog post |
| `/blog analyze <file-or-url>` | Audit blog quality with 0-100 score |
| `/blog brief <topic>` | Generate a detailed content brief |
| `/blog calendar [monthly\|quarterly]` | Generate an editorial calendar |
| `/blog strategy <niche>` | Blog strategy and topic ideation |
| `/blog outline <topic>` | Generate SERP-informed content outline |
| `/blog seo-check <file>` | Post-writing SEO validation checklist |
| `/blog schema <file>` | Generate JSON-LD schema markup |

| `/blog geo <file>` | AI citation readiness audit |
| `/blog audit [directory]` | Full-site blog health assessment |
| `/blog update <file>` | Update existing post with fresh stats (routes to rewrite) |

## Orchestration Logic

### Command Routing

1. Parse the user's command to determine the sub-skill
2. If no sub-command given, ask which action they need
3. Route to the appropriate sub-skill:
   - `write` → `blog-write` (new articles from scratch)
   - `rewrite` → `blog-rewrite` (optimize existing posts)
   - `analyze` → `blog-analyze` (quality scoring)
   - `brief` → `blog-brief` (content briefs)
   - `calendar` / `plan` → `blog-calendar` (editorial calendars)
   - `strategy` / `ideation` → `blog-strategy` (positioning and topics)
   - `outline` → `blog-outline` (SERP-informed outlines)
   - `seo-check` / `seo` → `blog-seo-check` (SEO validation)
   - `schema` → `blog-schema` (JSON-LD generation)
   - `repurpose` → `blog-repurpose` (cross-platform content)
   - `geo` / `aeo` / `citation` → `blog-geo` (AI citation audit)
   - `audit` / `health` → `blog-audit` (site-wide assessment)
   - `update` → `blog-rewrite` (with freshness-update mode)

### Platform Detection

Detect blog platform from file extension and project structure:

| Signal | Platform | Format |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `.mdx` files, `next.config` | Next.js/MDX | JSX-compatible markdown |
| `.md` files, `hugo.toml` | Hugo | Standard markdown |
| `.md` files, `_config.yml` | Jekyll | Standard markdown with YAML front matter |
| `.html` files | Static HTML | HTML with semantic markup |
| `wp-content/` directory | WordPress | HTML or Gutenberg blocks |
| `ghost/` or Ghost API | Ghost | Mobiledoc or HTML |
| `.astro` files | Astro | MDX or markdown |
| `.njk` files, `.eleventy.js` | 11ty | Nunjucks/Markdown |
| `gatsby-config.js` | Gatsby | MDX/React |

Adapt output format to detected platform. Default to standard markdown if unknown.

## Core Methodology -- The 6 Pillars

Every blog post targets these 6 optimization pillars:

| Pillar | Impact | Implementation |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Answer-First Formatting | +340% AI citations | Every H2 opens with 40-60 word stat-rich paragraph |
| Real Sourced Data | E-E-A-T trust | Tier 1-3 sources only, inline attribution |
| Visual Media | Engagement + citations | Pixabay/Unsplash images + built-in SVG chart generation |
| FAQ Schema | +28% AI citations | Structured FAQ with 40-60 word answers |
| Content Structure | AI extractability | 50-150 word chunks, question headings, proper H hierarchy |
| Freshness Signals | 76% of top citations | Updated within 30 days, dateModified schema |

## Quality Gates

These are hard rules. Never ship content that violates them:

| Rule | Threshold | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Fabricated statistics | Zero tolerance | Every number must have a named source |
| Paragraph length | Never > 150 words | Split or trim |
| Heading hierarchy | Never skip levels | H1 → H2 → H3 only |
| Source tier | Tier 1-3 only | Never cite content mills or affiliate sites |
| Image alt text | Required on all images | Descriptive, includes topic keywords naturally |
| Self-promotion | Max 1 brand mention | Author bio context only |
| Chart diversity | No duplicate types | Each chart must be a different type |

## Scoring Methodology

Blog quality is scored across 5 categories (100 points total):

| Category | Weight | What it measures |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Content Quality | 30 pts | Depth, readability (Flesch 60-70), originality, structure, engagement, grammar/anti-pattern |
| SEO Optimization | 25 pts | Heading hierarchy, title tag, keyword placement, internal linking, meta description |
| E-E-A-T Signals | 15 pts | Author attribution, source citations, trust indicators, experience signals |
| Technical Elements | 15 pts | Schema markup, image optimization, page speed, mobile-friendliness, OG meta |
| AI Citation Readiness | 15 pts | Passage citability, Q&A format, entity clarity, AI crawler accessibility |

### Scoring Bands

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 90-100 | Exceptional | Publish as-is, flagship content |
| 80-89 | Strong | Minor polish, ready for publication |
| 70-79 | Acceptable | Targeted improvements needed |
| 60-69 | Below Standard | Significant rework required |
| < 60 | Rewrite | Fundamental issues, start from outline |

## Teammates

| Teammate | Role |
|----------|------|
| `blog-researcher` | Research specialist -- finds statistics, sources, images, competitive data |
| `blog-writer` | Content generation specialist -- writes optimized blog content |
| `blog-seo` | SEO validation specialist -- checks on-page SEO post-writing |
| `blog-reviewer` | Quality assessment -- runs 100-point scoring, AI content detection |

### Teammate Details

**blog-researcher**: Spawned as a teammate via Agent Teams. Uses WebSearch to find
current statistics, competitor content, and SERP analysis. Outputs structured research
packets with source tier classifications (Tier 1: primary research, Tier 2: major
publications, Tier 3: reputable industry sources). Also sources Pixabay/Unsplash/Pexels
image URLs. Can send findings to `blog-writer` via `SendMessage`.

**blog-writer**: Receives research packets and content briefs. Writes content using the
selected template structure. Applies answer-first formatting, citation capsules, and
TL;DR blocks. Outputs platform-formatted content ready for the SEO teammate. Can send
completed draft to `blog-seo` via `SendMessage`.

**blog-seo**: Post-writing validation teammate. Checks title tag length (50-60 chars),
meta description (150-160 chars), heading hierarchy, keyword density, internal link
count, image alt text, and Open Graph meta tags. Returns pass/fail checklist. Can send
issues back to `blog-writer` via `SendMessage` for revision.

**blog-reviewer**: Final quality gate. Runs the full 5-category 100-point scoring
rubric. Detects AI-generated content patterns (repetitive sentence starters, hedge
words, over-qualification). Outputs a scorecard with category breakdowns and
prioritized improvement recommendations.

## Execution Flow

Standard execution order for `/blog write`:

1. **Parse** -- Identify topic, detect platform, select template
2. **Team Setup** -- Create agent team and tasks:
   ```
   TeamCreate("blog-write", "Write and optimize a blog post on <topic>")
   TaskCreate("research", "Research statistics, sources, SERP data for <topic>")
   TaskCreate("write-draft", "Write blog post using research packet and outline")
   TaskCreate("seo-validate", "Run on-page SEO validation on draft")
   TaskCreate("quality-score", "Run 100-point quality audit on final draft")
   ```
3. **Research** -- Spawn `blog-researcher` teammate for statistics, sources, SERP data
   ```
   Agent(prompt: "Research <topic>...", team_name: "blog-write", name: "blog-researcher")
   ```
4. **Outline** -- Build section structure from template + research gaps
5. **Write** -- Spawn `blog-writer` teammate with research packet and outline
   ```
   Agent(prompt: "Write blog post...", team_name: "blog-write", name: "blog-writer")
   ```
6. **Optimize** -- Spawn `blog-seo` teammate for on-page validation
   ```
   Agent(prompt: "Validate SEO...", team_name: "blog-write", name: "blog-seo")
   ```
7. **Score** -- Spawn `blog-reviewer` teammate for 100-point quality audit
   ```
   Agent(prompt: "Score blog post...", team_name: "blog-write", name: "blog-reviewer")
   ```
8. **Deliver** -- Mark all tasks complete, output final content with scorecard
   ```
   TaskUpdate("research", status: "completed")
   TaskUpdate("write-draft", status: "completed")
   TaskUpdate("seo-validate", status: "completed")
   TaskUpdate("quality-score", status: "completed")
   TeamDelete("blog-write")
   ```

Teammates communicate directly via `SendMessage` — the researcher sends findings to
the writer, the SEO teammate sends issues back to the writer for revision, and the
reviewer sends the final scorecard to the orchestrator.

For `/blog analyze`, only steps 1 and 7 run (read + score).
For `/blog audit`, step 7 runs in parallel across all posts in the directory via
the `blog-audit` team (see blog-audit sub-skill).

### Internal Workflows (Not User-Facing Commands)

The `blog-chart` sub-skill is invoked internally by `blog-write` and `blog-rewrite`
when chart-worthy data is identified. It is not a standalone slash command.
Users do not need to call it directly.

## Integration

Chart generation is built-in — no external dependencies required for full functionality.

**Optional companion skills** (for deeper analysis of published pages):
- `/seo` — Full SEO audit of published blog pages
- `/seo-schema` — Schema markup validation and generation
- `/seo-geo` — AI citation optimization audit

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Fabricate statistics | December 2025 Core Update penalizes unsourced claims |
| Use the same chart type twice | Visual monotony, reduces engagement |
| Keyword-stuff headings or meta | Google ignores/penalizes this |
| Bury answers in paragraphs | AI systems extract from section openers |
| Skip source verification | Broken links and wrong data destroy trust |
| Use tier 4-5 sources | Low authority hurts E-E-A-T |
| Generate without research | AI-generated consensus content is penalized |
| Skip visual elements entirely | Blogs with images get 94% more views |
